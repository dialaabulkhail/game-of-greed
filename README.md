## Overview

This lab is about tackling the highest risk and/or highest priority features - scoring, dice rolling and banking of points.

- Players can choose to reroll all six dice, losing their initial score in the hopes of scoring a higher one.

- Players can choose to save some of the dice already in a scoring position to attempt to make a higher score with the remaining dice. However, if a higher score isnâ€™t achieved with the reroll, the player scores 0 for the turn.

## API

- calculate_score() --> a class method that calculates score based on a tuple input of a dice roll.

- roll_dice() --> a class method that returns a tuple with random values between 1 and 6 . The length of tuple matches the argument passed in the method.

- shelf() --> This method receives arguments of points (integer), to add to the shelf.
shelf method temporarily store unbanked points.

- bank() --> This method adds any points on the shelf to the total(balance) and reset shelf to 0.
the output of the bank method is the amount of points added to total(balance) from shelf.

- clear_shelf() --> This method removes all unbanked points.
